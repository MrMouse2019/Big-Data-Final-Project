Imagine a place where your child\u2019s creativity is tapped, their intellect is nurtured, their artistic talents are sharpened, and they are supported and happy. Welcome to M.S. 907 - a place for students to discover who they were meant to be! Our school combines standards-based academic instruction, exposure to the arts, and a projects-based approach to educate our students. And for those who exhibit exceptional academic or artistic aptitude, our Gifted and Talented program will challenge them so they can excel. Our model relies on student choice and exposure. Each semester sixth and seventh grade students will choose an arts elective (music, visual arts, creative writing, theater, and dance) to explore their skillsets. In their eighth grade year, students may narrow their focus to one specific arts connection to supplement their academics as they prepare for high school, college, and professional careers. Daily academic experiences will also be enriched for all students by authentic curricular connections to the arts. Picture it! As part of their creative arts or music elective, your child can learn to write poetry or songs to show the experiences of those they learn about in their humanities classes. Or, during dance elective, they can choreograph a jazz piece using their newfound math knowledge. As students grow at M.S. 907, they will build positive and enduring relationships with each other and the adults around them and develop their sense of self. They will also practice critical life skills such as persistence, flexible thinking, and innovation, habits of mind which will prepare them to be productive citizens in a 21st century global community. Every day our students will live our motto: Curiosity and creativity spark self-discovery!",
