Dance: Come dressed in proper dance attire consisting of ballet shoes, fitted black dance clothing, and hair that is short or completely secured on top of the head. Auditioning students will take a ballet barre led by the teacher. Auditioning students will have the opportunity to present a short one-minute dance of your choice and bring your own music. Drama: Prepare two contrasting memorized monologues from a play, movie, or novel, each one minute long. You may be asked to participate in a group theater game. Instrumental Music: This program offers a jazz curriculum for students who play band and rhythm section instruments. We do not have a string program. Students must bring their own instrument, sticks and music to the audition. Be prepared to play a scale and selection of music from a book or solo of your own choice, and sight-read. You will complete a questionnaire, interview, and take a simple test for musical aptitude. Vocal Music: Perform a prepared song without CD/piano accompaniment from the following list: Amazing Grace, Simple Gifts, The National Anthem (Star Spangled Banner), My Favorite Things, God Bless America, Happy Birthday, and Somewhere. Students should avoid Top 40 or Pop music when at all possible. Applicants will also be evaluated on tonal memory, rhythmic and aural skills, and vocal technique through teacher-led vocal exercises. Visual Art: Prepare and present a professional portfolio (work completed on drawing paper, canvas, or photographed) of at least five pieces of original work drawn from real-life observations (including one self-portrait, one still-life, and one landscape). The portfolio needs to show a range of style. Sketchbooks are welcomed as extra drawings.
