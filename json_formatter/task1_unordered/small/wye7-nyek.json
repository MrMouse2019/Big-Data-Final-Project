No cables will be pulled from this manhole and no intrusive work is proposed. The proposed plan is to have a tanker truck on the adjacent property (pending access agreement) and run a hose over the fence and into the manhole (this is the shortest distance). The manhole is located in a vegetated portion of the Park. To provide safe access to the manhole, a small path would need to be cleared for the crew and their equipment. Con Edison is requesting authorization to clear a path approximately 3-ft wide to the manhole and around the structure. The duration of the work is approximately 2-3 days",
