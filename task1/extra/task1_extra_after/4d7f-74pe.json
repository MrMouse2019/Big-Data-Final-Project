                        "The Penny Harvest is the largest service learning program active in New York City, operating in more than 800 schools throughout the five boroughs including 5 schools in District 3 this year including PS111, NYC Lab School, NYC Museum School, Village Community School, and the Little Red School House.  Through the program, children gather pennies, make grants and take action to help people and causes that matter to them.  Annually, NYC children make hundreds of thousands of dollars in grants to protect the young and the elderly, support disaster relief and fight disease and defend the environment and human rights.   As children progress through the program, they learn to be responsible citizens, philanthropists and community organizers and leaders.  1) Gathering Pennies:  A school-wide, 4 week fall campaign to gather pennies to earn a $1,000 budget for student grant making.  2) Making Grants:  Student leaders, usually 10-15 students across multiple grades, meet weekly for 16 weeks to represent their school in grant making.  They research and discuss community issues with peers, and community members; identify, interview and visit potential grantees; and ultimately, make funding decisions. Students use research, problem solving, teamwork, leadership, and communication skills, and involve the entire student body in their research and decision making.  The $1,000 budget is most often broken into several small grants and service projects (Taking Action). 3) Taking Action: Student leaders organize a volunteer project of their choice, often involving the entire school.  Common Cents staff trains and supports teachers to link service projects with academic lessons, whether it be planting a garden, or planning a community health fair.  We credit our success to the year-round curriculum, training, and support we provide to schools and our commitment to research and innovation.  Common Cents trains an adult facilitator in each school (a Penny Harvest Coach) to work with a group of student leaders to run the year-long program.   We provide over 9 hours of professional development to teachers, as well as on-going assistance via on-site and remote support in order to establish a permanent culture of caring, philanthropy and involvement.  Our annually updated curriculum includes a step by step guide for teachers as well as supplemental lessons and web based content and tools. Lessons are provided across all subject areas and are linked to New York State learning standards and nationally recognized McCrel standards. We also provide penny harvesting tools for each student, \u201cpenny logistics\u201d, i.e. we transport the coins and turn them into cash for grant making, and grants administration to each school.    The funds we are seeking partially fund the costs associated with producing and distributing the Penny Harvest Kits (curriculum) and training to participating schools.",
                        "Each year, Second Stage Theatre\u2019s Student Matinee Series enables 1,200 students to experience and learn from professionally produced Off-Broadway theatre.  Second Stage has formed relationships with a number of junior and senior high schools throughout the five boroughs that consistently utilize this free service for their students.  A majority of participants attend vocational schools, and this program affords them one of very few opportunties to step outside their concentration.  In addition, many of the students\u2019 parents don\u2019t have the time, money, and/or inclination to take their children to theater so our matinee series gives them an educational experience they would otherwise not have.  This program not only offers students the chance to see live theatre, it also facilitates a comprehensive discussion between students, their teachers, and our artists regarding the themes and issues that are pervasive in the piece.  All participating classrooms receive a study guide, created and provided by Second Stage Theatre, to assist with this lesson.  These study guides are prepared to help the students think critically about the show.  Following each matinee there is a talk-back session with the cast and creative team that is coordinated by the artistic staff at Second Stage Theatre.  This talk-back gives students the chance to ask questions and interact with the actors, playwrights and directors who helped bring the piece to fruition.  This process makes the play relevant to the students\u2019 lives and puts a personal touch on the experience.  The partipants in the Student Matinee Series live throughout the five boroughs of New York City, range in age from 13-19, and come from diverse socio-economic backgrounds.  The schools we serve include Abraham Lincoln High School (Brooklyn), Baccalaureate School for Global Education (Queens), Cobble Hill High School (Brooklyn), Discovery High School (Bronx), Fashion Industries High School (Manhattan), Graphic Arts High School (Manhattan), Grover Cleveland High School (Queens), Halsey Junior High (Queens), Jacqueline Kennedy-Onassis High School (Manhattan), Washington Irving High School (Manhattan), Urban Academy (Manhattan), West Side High School (Manhattan), Boys and Girls Harbor (Manhattan) and Young Women\u2019s Leadership School (Manhattan).  On average, the students from these schools are 14% white, 29% black, 50% Hispanic or Latino, and 7% Asian.  Two-thirds (66%) qualify for free lunches.  Enrollment at these schools ranges from 131-3051 students, with an average of 1,259 students.",
                        "Project Ol\u00e9 offers students a unique experience of flamenco, an art form which boasts a history involving a wide range of diverse cultural influences, including Spanish, Judaic, Arabic, and Gypsy. Through the vehicle of flamenco, students are given the opportunity to learn geography, history, language, and culture as we integrate our programs into the school curriculum. We serve an average of 17,000 New York City public school students each year with our residencies, lecture-demonstrations and school shows and expect to serve more in the coming year. Our overall Arts Education program costs approximately $200,000 and we receive funding from a variety of government, corporate and private foundations to offset the costs. \n\nPopulation Served: Manhattan Bridges High School\nOpened in September 2003, Manhattan Bridges is a small, high school that caters to recent immigrants from Spanish speaking countries. All students are English Language Learners with varying degrees of fluency. Flamenco Vivo will work with the classroom teachers, all of whom are bilingual, to incorporate flamenco into class work. At this specialized school, Flamenco Vivo is uniquely positioned to expose students to aspects of their own heritage while aiding their transition to the United States. At Manhattan Bridges High School, Project Ol\u00e9 will include a lecture demonstration for the entire student body and in-depth 10-week residency activities for 3 classes (90 students). Manhattan Bridges serves a population of 465 students in grades 9-12. The demographics of the student body are 98% Hispanic, with 2% African, Asian, and Caucasian. 90% of the population qualifies for the free school lunch program. \n\nPopulation Served: PS 111\nSet amid the housing projects of Hell\u2019s Kitchen and the luxury of Central Park West, where most children are sent to private schools, PS 111 serves a poor and largely distressed population of students going through severe difficulties outside of school.  Large numbers of children from local homeless shelters are sent to the school.  Flamenco Vivo will provide a 10-session residency for two Kindergarten classes of up to 30 students each.  In addition to the Teaching Artist, a guitarist will be present at ever residency class.   Additionally, students will have the opportunity to see Flamenco Vivo Carlota Santana performing on tour at a local venue in lower Manhattan. The student body at PS 111 includes 67% Hispanic Students, 12% White, 14% Black, and 7% Asian students. 65% of students qualify for the free lunch program.",
