It represents a critical milestone in the City\u2019s Equity and Excellence for All agenda, and begins to lay out an approach to increasing diversity in the school system. The plan sets specific initial goals for making schools more diverse and inclusive that will be reported on annually. This includes 12 proposals to address policies and practices that pose challenges to school diversity; this report is organized in a way that aligns each activity to one of these proposals. ",

The end result is a better option for students, one whose culture reflects a single cohesive community and a higher instructional quality which leads to student achievement. These strategies are constructed with potential impacts on school diversity in mind.",

Additionally, in partnership with the Center for Strategic Solutions at NYU, ESI hosted a Critically Conscious Educators Rising (CCER) Series that convened a group of like-minded educators to focus on tying theory to practice in the pursuit of equity and racial justice in their classrooms, through their peers, and beyond. Through the ESI Leadership Institute, the DOE hosted a four-part collaborative series bringing together principals and assistant principals to explore systematic bias and racism in schools and what building leaders can do to disrupt it. Administrators and leaders from over 30 schools have come together to learn how to create a roadmap towards an equity-driven school community using data and guided by a root cause analysis process.",

These interventions have included transportation provided to admissions events, admissions hubs for students at fairs, trainings for shelter staff, shelter-based workshops, direct outreach to pre-Kindergarten non-applicants and other opportunities for targeted admissions support. In the 2016-17 admissions cycle, 41 percent of eligible students in shelter applied for Kindergarten, up from 36 the previous year. 32 percent of 8th graders in shelter listed 12 choices on their high school application \u2013 up from 27 percent the previous year, and higher than the citywide average.

In spring 2017, the DOE hosted inaugural SHS fairs in Brooklyn and the Bronx with the goal of increasing awareness about the SHS in communities that are underrepresented at the schools. ~5,000 people attended across both events. In 2017-18, the outreach team will continue to build upon this work by strengthening relationships with community partners with the goal of effectively promoting and increasing visibility of the SHS to students and families from underrepresented backgrounds. \n",

Many of these schools utilized this funding to provide planning time for school staff working on diversity issues, as well as to do additional recruitment and outreach to underrepresented populations through school fairs and direct communication to families. Additionally, schools also utilized this funding to better equip their schools to support diverse learners. Examples of these activities included full-day professional development and guest speakers. Of the 155 schools in the program, 10 schools received grants of up to $5,000 for this effort."
