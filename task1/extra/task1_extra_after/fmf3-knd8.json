                        "Local Legislation (including introduction) - Pass the Fair Chance Act (Intro 0318-2014), which would prohibit businesses from asking job seekers about their criminal record. The bill would establish that employers could only ask an applicant about any criminal past after offering the job. At that point, the business could not take back the offer unless the applicant\u00c6s crime was specifically related to the job. This policy already applies to government employment. The bill would not cover jobs that require background checks. The bill currently has 35 members supporting and is assigned to the Civil Rights committee.; Resolution - Pass a resolution in support of the Fairness & Equity Act (S7927)\u00fb a statewide bill that will decriminalize small amounts of marijuana in plainview and burning. Additionally the bill will create a vacate process for the more than 600,000 individuals already victimized by broken marijuana laws to have their records cleared and create a more accountabile criminal justice system by utilizing racial and ethnic impact statements.; Resolution - Pass a resolution calling on Commissioner Bratton to implement a lowest law enforcement priority (LLEP) for marijuana arrests in New York City. ; Rule - Call on all New York City District Attorneys to consider a non-prosecution policy for low-level marijuana charges similar to the initiative implemented by Brooklyn DA Ken Thompson.; Budget - Fill gaps in access to harm reduction services, particularly in Brooklyn and Staten Island, by increasing funding and other resources.; Rule - Commit NYC to fully supporting the Plan to End AIDS in NY by 2020, announced by Gov. Cuomo earlier this year.; City Council Oversight Hearing - Hold a hearing on overdose to explore policy options to support progress to date and find new solutions, particularly with regard to preventing cocaine poisoning deaths, and overdose deaths generally among particular populations at risk, including homeless and youth heroin users.; Non-procurement - Call for a dedicated Mayor\u00c6s Office of Drug Policy.; Local Legislation (including introduction) - Create a pre-arrest diversion program modeled on the Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion program pioneered in Seattle, which  links low-level drug and prostitution offenders to health and social services instead of involving them in the criminal justice system.; Rule - Rescind HASA\u00c6s new welfare-to-work policy for dependents due to the adverse consequences for people living with HIV/AIDS and their families.; Rule - Implement HRA\u00c6s written policy for addressing transgender clients \u00fb \u00f4Serving Transgender, Transsexual and Gender Nonconforming Individuals\u00f6 \u00fb and hold staff accountable for policy violations.    Align HRA\u00c6s gender marker policy with those of the State Department and the Social Security Administration. HRA should advocate for NYS OTDA to make this change within WMS.; Rule - Change HASA\u00c6s medical eligibility criteria to allow all low-income people living with HIV to qualify for life-saving housing assistance, regardless of disease progression, which will support treatment adherence. The current eligibility criteria is outdated and does not acknowledge the vital role that stable housing plays in HIV healthcare and prevention.; Budget - Prioritize federal HOPWA funding for homeless and unstably housed people living with HIV who currently do not qualify for HASA, i.e. people with HIV who are asymptomatic or are undocumented. NYC should also continue to provide housing assistance for people living with HIV who are ineligible for HASA with federal Ryan White funding.; Rule - Reduce HASA\u00c6s reliance on commercial SROs for emergency shelter for homeless people living with HIV/AIDS. The remaining number of emergency shelter units needed should primarily be contract-based transitional housing providers with onsite staff who can help clients obtain permanent housing.; Rule - Restore funding for HRA broker\u00c6s fee payments (equivalent to one month\u00c6s rent) and security vouchers for homeless clients seeking private market apartments, including HASA clients in the rental assistance program.    Update HASA\u00c6s rent payment standards to 110% of HUD\u00c6s Fair Market Rent (FMR) guidelines, the standard guide traditionally used for Section 8 in NYC.    Require HASA case managers to review client eligibility for the DRIE and SCRIE programs, and actively assist eligible clients with enrolling in the programs in order to freeze future rent increases.",

It would also create a dedicated vending law enforcement unit, which would exclusively enforce vending laws. It would focus first on those areas of the City with known vending enforcement challenges, and move to all areas as compliance improves. It would also create a street vendor advisory board, which will includes vendors, brick and mortar small businesses, representatives from community groups and city agencies, to examine the rules for duplicative, unclear, or unnecessary provisions.",

TGNC Rental Assistance Program Pilot - A pilot to provide a special rental assistance program for TGNC people, given the community\u0393??s disproportionately high homeless rates.     TGNC Immigration Lawyer Training - Funding for a pilot group of non-profits to conduct training, geared for immigration attorneys, that educates about TGNC people and the means of attaining specialized visas (e.g., U Visas, which are for survivors of crimes that inflicted physical or mental abuse) that are most useful in helping undocumented TGNC people maintain safe residence in the US.     TGNC Immigration Lawyer Staffing - Funding for non-profits to hire lawyers that are knowledgeable of both the visas that TGNC undocumented people need, and TGNC community needs. Grants should be made to cover the cost of a staff member.    TGNC Healthcare Liaison Program - Funding for staff at city hospitals that can act as case managers and advocates for TGNC patients, to help enforce peoples\u0393?? rights within the health care system and make sure every part of their care team is in communication to make the best possible health care outcomes.     Training/Evaluation on NYPD/TGNC Community Issues - TGNC organizations should once again take part in the training process of NYPD officers, and make changes to NYPD training as soon as possible. Furthermore, funding should be provided for an evaluation of this new training with TGNC-led organizations taking a major role in the evaluation process ($25,000), and $22,900 should be provided to community organizations to inform the TGNC community about their rights in interactions with police.  , City Council Oversight Hearing - I have pitched budget proposals to create the following for the transgender and gender non-conforming (TGNC) community:    TGNC Employment Program - Funding for a program that can work with TGNC youth and adults in separate cohorts, and prepare them for careers.
