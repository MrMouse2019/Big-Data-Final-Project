The DOE will begin to expand the Discovery program to 20 percent of seats at each SHS and adjust the eligibility criteria to target students attending high-poverty schools.

The elimination of the SHSAT would require State legislation. By the end of the elimination, the SHS would use the \u201cUniversity of Texas model,\u201d where seats are reserved for top performers at each New York City middle school.

Through the pre-K, kindergarten and Gifted and Talented admissions processes, ELL, STH and students eligible for FRL received priority for 67% of offers.\n\nFor fall 2018 admissions, seven of the 16 elementary schools in District 1 made offers within their target range \u2013 offering 57 to 77 percent of kindergarten seats to students identified as FRL, ELL, and/or STH. This is nearly double the four elementary schools in District 1 whose kindergarten enrollment was within the target range in the 2017-18 school year. Of the nine District 1 elementary schools that are not in the target range for offers, five moved closer to the target range as compared to their 2017-18 enrollment. Additionally, as part of District 1\u2019s Diversity in Admissions priorities, 15 of the 16 elementary schools made kindergarten offers to a percentage of students with disabilities (SWD) near the district average \u2013 offering 9 to 29 percent of kindergarten seats to SWD. This progress is supported by the district\u2019s Family Resource Center, which opened in October 2017 and is a one-stop shop for families to learn about and enroll in District 1 schools.",

The Advisory Group also includes city government stakeholders, local and national experts on school diversity, parents, advocates, students, and other community leaders. During the 2017-18 school year, the SDAG and its subcommittees have collectively held approximately 30 meetings and one day-long retreat to facilitate research and discussion of a number of key policy areas related to diversity. The SDAG hosted public town halls in every borough across NYC and a youth symposium to collect data from communities on the issues important to them. In December 2018, the SDAG will release a preliminary report and will continue to serve in its capacity into the new year.",

In the 2018 admissions cycle, 52 percent of eligible students in shelter applied for Kindergarten, up from 41 the previous year.  74 percent of 5th graders in shelter participated in middle school admissions, compared to 79 percent last year.  98% of shelter students received an offer compared to 95% of all students.

For summer 2017, the DREAM Summer/Fall Intensive more than doubled, serving about 650 students. 185 students received an offer, up from 113 last year.
