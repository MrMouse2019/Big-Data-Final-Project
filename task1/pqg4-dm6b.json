                            "The East Harlem Neighborhood Based Alliance Corporation (EHNBAC) is a non-profit organization established on March 3rd 1993, as part of a State-wide initiative implemented under the New York State Neighborhood Based Alliance (NBA) laws of 1990.   The objectives of this State-wide initiative was: 1) through the operation of a crisis intervention center, to stabilize volatile situations for families and individuals in crisis situations or to address situations that if left unaddressed could become crisis, and 2) to improve long-term economic and social conditions through the development and implementation of a Strategic Neighborhood Action Plan (SNAP).  Since 1993, over 2,000 individuals and families have been placed in decent, affordable apartments, over 4,000 families have averted homelessness, over 2,000 families have avoided serious injury or death, have been placed in safe houses, and have secured monetary compensation and over 1,000 individuals have received HIV/AIDS services.Although the EHNBAC downscaled its operation after NYS Neighborhood Based Alliance Initiative sunset in 1996 it continues to serve approximately 600 individuals and families per year.  Most staff are bilingual in Spanish and English.  The EHNBAC provides crime victims with legal advocacy, family court advocacy around divorce, child visitation, child support, orders of protection.  We accompany participants to precincts, court, and the District Attorney?s Office.  Emergency Assistance for VictimsWe provide emergency services such as the changing of locks, purchase of furniture, clothing, pampers, food and payment of legal and documentation fees to regain lost or missing identification and legal documents, relocation assistance, and rent assistance if the victim is at risk of eviction.  We provide advocacy to obtain repairs, initiation of overcharge claims, tenant landlord mediation, money management training, legal advocacy, and assistance in securing and maintaining entitlements and benefits.  In July 2005, in response to the high rates of HIV/AIDS in East Harlem, the EHNBAC instituted its HIV/AIDS education program known as Awareness Can Change Every Persons Tomorrow (ACCEPT).  Since then, over 900 individuals have received education and services focusing on the prevention of HIV/AIDS.  The EHNBAC ACCEPT program provides case management, crisis intervention services, prevention workshops, individual and family counseling sessions, referrals to treatment at local hospitals and medical centers in the community, information and referral,  permanency planning and condom distribution.  Its Homelessness Prevention Program aims to prevent eviction through Housing Court representation, tenant/landlord mediation and emergency cash assistance paid directly to landlords or utility providers.  If relocation is the appropriate alternative, the EHNBAC will secure alternative housing placement for families where eviction cannot be avoided.",

                            "Social Security Retirement, Disability and Survivors Insurance programs are federal insurance programs for workers administered by the Social Security Administration.  Enacted in 1935, the Social Security Act originally was a retirement program intended to provide financial support for elderly workers who coould no longer perform gainful labor.  In more than half a century since its enactment, coverage has been added for other groups of workers.  Social  Security also administers a needs based program called Supplemental Security Income(SSI) for those who do not have sufficient coverage to entitle them to Social Security benefits and who meet certain income and resource limits. Nearly 60 percent of the people receiving Social Security benefits are women.  In the 21st century, more women work, pay Social security taxes and earn credit toward their own monthly retirement income than in any other time in our nation's history. Women tend to care for many people including spouses, children and parents.  Women are more likely to earn less over their lifetimes than men.  Women are less often covered by private retirement plans and more dependent on Social Security- and for a longer period of time since, on average, women live about five years longer than men. When women work, they pay taxes into the Social Security system, providing their own benefits. Women who do not work are often covered through their husbands' work and can receive benefits based on their current husband or prior husband's work record when they retire, become disabled or die. Women should remember to contact Social Security to correct the information Social Security has for them, if they change their name through divorce or marriageFor information on benefits, entitlement, and eligibility go to www.socialsecurity.gov/women. The web site has a specific section devoted to women's issues. At age 65, most women will be eligible for Medicare Par A if they are eligible for benefits on their own record or on their husband's record.  Women will have the opportunity to buy Medicare medical insurance (Part B) for a monthly premium.  If they are not eligible for a benefit because they do not have enough credits, they can purchase Medicare coverage by paying a monthly premium.  For more information, go to  www.Medicare.gov or call the toll-free Medicare information number at 1-800-633-4227. For more Social Security information visit our web site at www.socialsecurity.gov.
