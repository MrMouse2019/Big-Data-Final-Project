                            "The Queens HS for Language Studies is a committed, caring community of learners. Located in Flushing, Queens, we are a small, close-knit high school with the opportunities of a large campus. In addition to taking a challenging core curriculum, every student at QHSLS is learning language. Fifty percent of our students are native-Chinese speakers learning English as a new language, and fifty percent are English-speakers learning Chinese as a foreign language throughout all four years of high school. All students are expected to achieve an Advanced Regents diploma, and with the support of dedicated teachers, counselors, and fellow classmates, our students are prepared for the next stage confident in their academic skills and ready for success in college.",
