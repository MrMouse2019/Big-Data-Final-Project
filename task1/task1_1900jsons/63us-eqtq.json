I am requesting that the city publish its vital records indices online as open data.Please note that this is not a request for any actual certificate information, which of course have strict privacy rules, but merely the indices to the basic data.  These data sets, which are held by the New York City Department of Health, have been previously published in other (older) forms, although all are incomplete.  For example, the city birth index from 1881-1965 is available as microfilm images at Family History Libraries across the world, and the city death index through 1982 or 1983 is available in a tiny number of libraries in printed book form.Agreeing that the indices are public data, the New York State (not city) Department of Health has recently begun adding their State death index data to their Socrata portal for the years 1957-1962.  It would be nice to see the city follow suit.Here are the data sets that would be helpful:1) Index of all births reported in the city of New York, 1881 (or as early as data is available) through 2012 (or as recently as data is available)  Fields in this dataset should include, at a minimum:- first name- surname- gender- date of birth (or year, if date is unavailable)- borough of birth- certificate number2) Index of all deaths reported in the city of New York, 1881 (or as early as data is available) through 2012 (or as recently as data is available)  Fields in this dataset should include, at a minimum:- first name- surname- gender- date of death (or year, if date is unavailable)- borough of death- certificate number3) Index of all marriages reported in the city of New York, 1881 (or as early as data is available) through 2012 (or as recently as data is available)  Fields in this dataset should include, at a minimum:- first name of bride (or spouse #1)- surname of bride (or spouse #1)- gender of of bride (or spouse #1)- date of birth (or year, if date is unavailable) of bride (or spouse #1)- first name of groom (or spouse #2)- surname of groom (or spouse #2)- gender of of groom (or spouse #2)- date of birth (or year, if date is unavailable) of groom (or spouse #2)- date of marriage (or date of issuance of marriage license)- borough where marriage took place- certificate number4) Index of all domestic partnerships reported in the city of New York, 1997 through 2012 (or as recently as data is available)  Fields in this dataset should include, at a minimum:- first name of partner #1- surname of partner #1- gender of of partner #1- date of birth (or year, if date is unavailable) of partner #1- first name of partner #2- surname of partner #2- gender of of partner #2- date of birth (or year, if date is unavailable) of partner #2- date of issuance of partnership certificate- borough of residence of the partners- certificate numberFor the index to divorce decrees and/or certificates, you will probably have to direct this request to each individual borough in the city, to their courts, not to the city's Department of Health:5) Index of all divorces reported in the city of New York, 1881 (or as early as data is available) through 2012 (or as recently as data is available)  Fields in this dataset should include, at a minimum:- first name of bride (or spouse #1)- surname of bride (or spouse #1)- gender of of bride (or spouse #1)- date of birth (or year, if date is unavailable) of bride (or spouse #1)- first name of groom (or spouse #2)- surname of groom (or spouse #2)- gender of of groom (or spouse #2)- date of birth (or year, if date is unavailable) of groom (or spouse #2)- date of divorce decree or certificate- borough where divorce took place- certificate number or decree numberI anticipate that the NYC Department of Health may try to claim to you that these indices are private or protected data, but as I mentioned in my initial request e-mails, this is clearly not the case.  The certificates are private, yes, but the indices are not private, are not copyrighted, and have been published in other forms previously.Please let me know if there is any other information you'd like me to provide regarding this request.  Thanks.",
                        "I'd like for NYC to open the Public Access Defibrillation registry, which is held by the Fire Department of New York and/or New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene in coordination with NYC's Regional Emergency Medical Services Council (NYC REMSCO).Context and details:There are various programs in New York City & New York State eitherencouraging or requiring buildings/businesses/locations to have automated external defibrillators (AEDs) available for public use. New York state law & NYC law applies; also see NYC local law 20 - mandated, and New York City Administrative Code \u00a7  17-188.Per the New York State Department of Health advisory on Public Access Defibrillation at  https://www.health.ny.gov/professionals/ems/policy/09-03.htm , each regional emergency medical services council holds a PAD registry. In New York City, that is NYC REMSCO http://www.nycremsco.org/bcls.asp?intCategoryID=10&intArticleID=329 . The REMSCO shares this with 911 operators, who, in case of cardiac arrest, can advise callers if there's a PAD at the address they're calling from.The last publicly published map of PAD locations in New York City was in 2006 http://www.nyc.gov/html/records/pdf/govpub/2498reportonlocallaw20july2006final.pdf . Per that report, NYC REMSCO has \"an online registration system intended to facilitate registration, reduce paperwork, and improve the scope and accuracy of future reporting to City Council\", and this was developed in coordination with New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH).The Fire Department of NY advertises a Be 911 apphttp://www1.nyc.gov/site/fdny/about/resources/mobile-applications/fdny-be-911-life-saver-app.page which accesses NYC's PAD registry and tells the user of 3 AEDs near the user's location. Thus we know that this dataset is available, machine-readable, and regularly updated, and that at least part of the stewardship of this dataset is through the Fire Department.Per NYC REMSCO's \"Elements of a Successful and Compliant PAD Program\" http://www.nycremsco.org/images/articlesserver/01-Elements%20of%20a%20Successful%20and%20Compliant%20PAD%20Program.pdf , the PAD registry includes data from the following forms:* Notice of Intent to Provide Public Access Defibrillation* PAD Provider Information Form* Collaborative Agreement* Quality Assurance Report",

                        "Zinc deficiency induces apoptosis via mitochondrial p53- and caspase-dependent pathways in human neuronal precursor cells - Previous studies have shown that zinc deficiency leads to apoptosis of neuronal precursor cells in vivoand in vitro. In addition to the role of p53 as a nuclear transcription factor in zinc deficient culturedhuman neuronal precursors (NT-2), we have now identified the translocation of phosphorylated p53 tothe mitochondria and p53-dependent increases in the pro-apoptotic mitochondrial protein BAX leadingto a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential as demonstrated by a 25% decrease in JC-1 red:greenfluorescence ratio. Disruption of mitochondrial membrane integrity was accompanied by efflux of theapoptosis inducing factor (AIF) from the mitochondria and translocation to the nucleus with a significantincrease in reactive oxygen species (ROS) after 24 h of zinc deficiency. Measurement of caspase cleavage,mRNA, and treatment with caspase inhibitors revealed the involvement of caspases 2, 3, 6, and 7 inzinc deficiency-mediated apoptosis. Down-stream targets of caspase activation, including the nuclearstructure protein lamin and polyADP ribose polymerase (PARP), which participates in DNA repair, werealso cleaved. Transfection with a dominant-negative p53 construct and use of the p53 inhibitor, pifithrin-\u00e8\u2030\u00b6\u00ef\u00bd\u00a8, established that these alterations were largely dependent on p53. Together these data identify a cascadeof events involving mitochondrial p53 as well as p53-dependent caspase-mediated mechanisms leadingto apoptosis during zinc deficiency.",

With a small group of my colleagues, we are building our quantitative skills at CSSW in our Advanced Research and Statistics class, with Dr. Eva Haldane, and are looking for secondary data to inform a semester-long research project.  Our project is intended for class purposes only, not for publication.  We would like to investigate access to health care services, especially STI and/or HIV prevention and treatment, for sex workers, but the scope of our project will be defined in detail once we obtain a data set.

We would like to know the relationship between both the files and how the files are used to show the parking restrictions. Because both files are connected by the Status-Order Number and Boro code. But how it\u2019s used in the depicting the parking restrictions we can\u2019t find it. I would like to request you that can you please help us in the API. We are developing an application for one of our client. The application will showcase the users to view the parking restrictions in New York. The users will be able to view the parking status on the app like your nycdot.info website.Hello, We would like to request you that can you guys help us in nycdot.info website.

                        "The local law defines data as final versions of statistical or factual information (1) in alphanumeric form reflected in a list, table, graph, chart or other non-narrative form, that can be digitally transmitted or processed; and (2) regularly created or maintained by or on behalf of and owned by an agency that records a measurement, transaction, or determination related to the mission of an agency.  Such term shall not include information provided to an agency by other governmental entities, nor shall it include image files, such as designs, drawings, maps, photos, or scanned copies of original documents, provided that it shall include statistical or factual information about such image files and shall include geographic information system data.  The Zoning Resolution is a set of regulations - it is not a data set.  To try to distill zoning regulations into a table or even a series of tables is overly reductive and not an accurate representation of the law.  The table that you refer to that is available from DCPs website is an extract from the Zoning Handbook, last published in 2011.  While the Handbook is a helpful guide, it is just that, and there's a context for its utility. DCP does not regularly create or maintain such tables, and data, per the definition, is required to be regularly created or maintained and excludes image files and copies of original documents.  We will likely have to update the Handbook tables in the near future, since the Zoning for Quality and Affordability zoning text amendment was adopted by the City Council on March 22nd and represents one of the most comprehensive changes to the ZR in decades.  That said, we would not update them on a regular basis going forward to reflect every nuance of zoning that changes.  That is why referring people to the ZR itself is the \"safest\" and most accurate thing to do.  We don't disagree that these tables are useful and helpful, but we do not believe they belong in Open Data. While they represent the framework of zoning, we do not want to overemphasize or mischaracterize their utility.  Moreover, there are various tables within the Zoning Resolution, and we would not want to confuse the public with additional tables that look like the legal tables but which are not.",
                        "Hi ,I would not suggest aggregating and dividing any census information into arbitrary districts or geometries. You would end up splitting census tracts and then would have to estimate how to reassign split population to each new cube. For example, if one of your cubes splits a census tract by 80% and that tract has 10,000 people - you would most likely assign 80% (8,000 people) to that cube, but in reality, only 2,000 people might actually live in that split up portion.I would suggest using City Planning's Neighborhood Tabulation Area's (NTAs). NTAs are small geographic areas that were created by the New York City Department of City Planning, using whole census tracts from the 2010 Census as building blocks. Each NTA\u2019s boundaries are consistent with Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs), approximations of New York City's Community Districts developed for use with the Census Bureau's Public Use Microdata Samples (PUMS). You could then divide population by NTA without splitting census tracts and the data will virtually align to Community Districts (with slight variance).Data Access:NTA boundaries: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Neig...Census Demographics at NTA level: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Cens...Demographic Profiles by PUMA boundaries: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Demo...PUMA boundaries: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/...For land use information use MapPLUTO:https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-...The lots can be split up by NTA and re-aggregated to get percentage of uses in each NTA.Use the Land Use field. To find out the meaning of each Land Use value use the the PLUTO data dictionary (page 21):https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/...Thank you,- Department of City Planning",
                        "Hi ,At this time, we believe that your requested dataset is not maintained by a New York City agency.This may be due to the fact that some organizations that operate in the City of New York may not fall under the purview of the NYC open data law. You can find further detail on the law here:http://www1.nyc.gov/site/doitt/initiatives/open-da...Furthermore, there are no official neighborhood boundaries, since neighborhoods are not defined by the City (i.e. nothing says Chelsea ends at 23rd st, etc). The closest dataset available to a neighborhood is the Neighborhood Tabulation Areas (NTAs). This is the full description of NTAs: Geographic files of Neighborhood Tabulation Areas (NTAs) as created by the New York City Department of City Planning, using whole census tracts from the 2010 Census as building blocks. These aggregations of census tracts are subsets of New York City's 55 Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs). Primarily due to these constraints, NTA boundaries and their associated names may not definitively represent historical or traditional neighborhoods.Available here: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Neighborhood-Tabulation-Areas/cpf4-rkhqSee also, neighborhood name points for map label display purposes only: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Neighborhood-Names-GIS/99bc-9p23Since you are specifically looking for homeowner associations and subdivisions within SI, you may also want to query the Owner Name field in the MapPLUTO dataset - which is a dataset of all tax parcels in NYC with additional attribute information added. You can access that file here:https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-...Thank you,- Department of City Planning",
                        "Hi , Unfortunately, I do not think you can reliably identify homeowners vs renters using the Multiple Dwelling Registration data. It is not uncommon, for example, for a landlord owning a 4 unit (or larger) building to personally reside in that building while the other units are rental. That same landlord may register the building as owned by \"Jane Smith\" or owned by \"123 Park St LLC\" -- the registration information doesn't reveal homeowner/rental status. As you probably know, coop and condo buildings make up a large part of NYC's housing stock. It's very common for condo and coop buildings to contain renters in addition to homeowners. All of that said, the best proxy for this information that I\u2019m aware of is through the NYC Dept. of Finance data. Citywide building data can be downloaded here: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/finance/taxes/property-assessments.page Building classification codes provide approximate data for rental vs. owned. There is no official guide on this, but what I can tell you is that, broadly speaking, building classes that start with \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d are small 1 or 2 family dwellings which may be owner occupied and/or rented. Building classes that start with \u201cC\u201d or \u201cD\u201d are rentals or co-ops, depending upon if the specific description for each contains the word co-op/cooperative. And classes that start with \u201cR\u201d are condo. https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/finance/jump/hlpbldgcode.htmlBut again, buildings that with a co-op or condo building class may contain individual units that are being rented out at any given point in time - it's very common in my experience. I hope this is helpful.NYC Housing Preservation & Development (HPD)"
