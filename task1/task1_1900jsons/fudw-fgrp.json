                        "<p>\t<strong>Hip hop, Indie-rock, punk and folk artists committed to social change will come together to honor musician and activist Pete Seeger</strong>. <strong>The program&rsquo;s hosts are Gina Belafonte, Harry Belafonte&rsquo;s daughter and Kitama Jackson, Pete Seeger&rsquo;s grandson.</strong></p><p>\tMr. Seeger and Mr. Belafonte became international household names as singers who stood for change. For Belafonte that meant being involved in both the Civil Rights Movement in US and the Anti-Apatheid movement in South Africa. For Seeger that meant getting people singing, and then using song to lead marches and rallies around the world. From the labor movement to the Civil Rights movement to the environmental movement, Pete Seeger was always on the front lines.</p><p>\tToday&rsquo;s artists aren&rsquo;t that different from Seeger and Belafonte, they also use music as a means to give voice to the voiceless and inspire people to change the world for themselves, their communities and future generations.&nbsp;</p><p>\t<strong><a href=\"http://www.anti-flag.com\">Anti-Flag</a></strong> have been spreading their message of unity to the masses for two decades. Through the years, they&rsquo;ve gone from non-stop tours crisscrossing North America in a dilapidated van to world tours spanning five continents. From humble beginnings in the Steel Town, Anti-Flag has worked hard to use music as a force for positive change. They are advocates for worker and human rights, environmentalism, animal rights, healthcare, conscientious objectors, prison reform and freedom for political prisoners, equality and peace. Last year Anti-Flag celebrated 20 years as a band. The band joined forces with Art For Amnesty to release an electrifying version of &ldquo;Toast To Freedom,&rdquo; the now-classic commemorative song written to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Amnesty International. The track &mdash; inspired by the imprisonment of Russian activist punk band Pussy Riot and benefiting human rights organization Amnesty International &ndash; was recorded at the legendary Hansa Studio in Berlin, Germany, and features Donots, Ian D&rsquo;Sa of Billy Talent, and Bernd of Beatsteaks. Anti-Flag&rsquo;s music and message is a call to action for people of all backgrounds and beliefs to focus on making tomorrow a better place for all. As Anti-Flag celebrates 20 years, they carry the torch forward putting emphasis of the band and every show played on community.</p><p>\t<a href=\"http://www.toniblackman.com/\"><strong>Toni Blackman</strong></a> is the first Hip Hop artist selected to work as a US Hip Hop Ambassador with&nbsp; the US Department of State.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her experiences in cultural diplomacy as an artist enables her to move through various communities (the arts, political circles, international gatherings, youth groups, academia, music industry, etc).&nbsp; As an official Hip hop Envoy she has traveled extensively throughout South Africa, Botswana, Senegal, Ivory Coast, Swaziland, Taiwan, Indonesia, the Philippines, performing and working in more than 30 different countries.&nbsp; She has also served as a juror for the American Music Abroad tour,&nbsp; a judge for ExchangesConnect programs, worked with international cultural arts competition, and has been consulted on selection of talent from both North America and Africa for various department initiatives.&nbsp; An Echoing Green Fellow, a former Open Society Institute Fellow, creator of Freestyle Union and Rhyme like a Girl, Toni is both highly respected as an artist and social entrepreneur.&nbsp; She was commissioned by the African Continuum Theater Company in Washington, DC to co-write and co-star in &ldquo;The Hip Hop Nightmares of Jujube Brown&rdquo; and has featured pieces at the NY Hip Hop Theater Festival.&nbsp; Toni&rsquo;s first book<em>, Inner-Course</em> was released in 2003 (Villard/Random House).&nbsp; She recently completed <em>Wisdom of the Cipher </em>which will be released late Spring/Summer 2014. Her new book, <em>Travels of a Lyrical Ambassador:&nbsp; A Poetic Memoir</em>, has a 2015 release date, and will have an accompanying soundtrack.</p><p>\t<strong>The Chapin Sisters</strong>, Lily &amp; Abigail Chapin are known for pristine harmonies and haunting melodies. They&rsquo;ve been compared to sister acts of old and Appalachian family groups, yet their original songs and arrangements have a very contemporary aspect, with elements of pop, blues, folk, and even psychedelic rock. Abigail and Lily were born in Brooklyn New York. They couldn&rsquo;t help but pick up a thorough grounding in traditional American roots music and folk-rock from their father, 3-time Grammy Award winning singer-songwriter Tom Chapin. He, along with their grandfather Jim Chapin, a jazz drummer, and their uncle, singer-songwriter Harry Chapin, created an environment wherein music held an almost sacred purpose, of bringing people together, whether it be for family, humanitarian purposes, or joyful release.&nbsp; When the family relocated to New York&rsquo;s Hudson Valley, the girls attended a Waldorf school whose arts-based education added training in orchestral music and the complicated harmonies of Shape-note songs and old English folk ballads. Through elementary and high school they sang on over a dozen studio albums. With two critically-acclaimed full-length albums under their belt, 2008&rsquo;s Lake Bottom LP and 2010&rsquo;s Two, Abigail and Lily released A Date with the Everly Brothers in the Spring of 2013. Recorded in one day, live in the studio with a full band in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, the album includes 14 of the sisters&rsquo; favorite Everlys songs, a tribute as well as a master class in harmony singing. The album was featured on NPR&rsquo;s Weekend Edition, The New York Times&rsquo; T magazine, and included on many year-end top 10 lists. The Chapin Sisters are currently working on their next album.</p><p>\tFronted by MC&rsquo;s&nbsp;Rodstarz, and MC/Producer&nbsp;G1,&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"http://rebeldiaz.blogspot.com/\">Rebel Diaz</a> </strong>shows us the true global power of Hip-Hop. After first performing at an immigrant rights march in New York City in 2006 in front of a half million people, the bilingual crew has taken the international community by storm with their explosive live shows. With influences ranging from Chicago house to South American folk, Rebel Diaz combines classic boom bap tradition with Hip-Hop&rsquo;s global impact. The group&rsquo;s versatility has allowed for them to share the stage with the likes of Common, Mos Def, and Public Enemy, while feeling right at home with acts like Rage Against the Machine and Calle 13. Multiple tours throughout Europe and Latin America have only solidified their international appeal. With roots in Chicago, and now based in the South Bronx, Rebel Diaz has also piqued the interest of the academic community with their poignant social commentary and energetic performances. They have spent the last 8 years visiting dozens of colleges and universities, facilitating workshops, speaking on panels, and performing at national conferences. Building on this growing network of positive young people in Hip-Hop, the group opened a community arts center in the South Bronx in 2008, the Rebel Diaz Arts Collective (RDACBX). On the heels of their critically acclaimed Otro Guerrillero mixtape series, and 2011&prime;s #Occupy The Airwaves mixtape, Rebel Diaz released their debut album, The Radical Dilemma, in December 2013.</p><p>\tA prot&eacute;g&eacute; of legendary songwriters Townes Van Zandt and Guy Clark,&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"http://steveearle.com/\">Steve Earle </a></strong>quickly became a master&nbsp;storyteller in his own right, with his songs being recorded by Johnny&nbsp;Cash, Willie Nelson, Emmylou&nbsp;Harris, Waylon Jennings, Travis Tritt, The Pretenders, Joan Baez and&nbsp;countless others. 1986 saw the release of his debut record, Guitar Town, which shot to number one on&nbsp;the country charts and immediately&nbsp;established the term &ldquo;New Country.&rdquo; What followed was an extremely&nbsp;exciting and varied array of&nbsp;releases including the biting hard rock of Copperhead Road (1988), the&nbsp;minimalist beauty of Train A&nbsp;Comin&rsquo; (1995), the politically charged masterpiece, Jerusalem (2002)&nbsp;and the Grammy Award Winning&nbsp;albums The Revolution Starts&hellip;Now (2004), Washington Square Serenade&nbsp;(2007) and Townes (2009). I&rsquo;ll&nbsp;Never Get Out Of This World Alive (2011) is Steve Earle&rsquo;s 14th Studio&nbsp;Album and shares the same name with his&nbsp;2011 debut novel. Of the novel, Patti Smith stated, &ldquo;Steve Earle&nbsp;brings to his prose the same authenticity,&nbsp;poetic spirit and cinematic energy he projects in his music. I&rsquo;ll&nbsp;Never Get Out Of This World Alive is like a&nbsp;dream you can&rsquo;t shake, offering beauty and remorse, redemption in spades.&rdquo;</p><p>\tNearly a decade after folk-rock duo <strong><a href=\"http://www.sarahleeandjohnny.com/\">Sarah Lee Guthrie and Johnny Irion</a></strong> put out their first album together, the husband-and-wife pair feel like they&rsquo;ve finally hit their stride on Wassaic Way, a collection of 11 new songs to be released August 6th on Rte 8 Records. Produced by Wilco&rsquo;s Jeff Tweedy and Patrick Sansone at the Loft in Chicago, Wassaic Way finds Guthrie and Irion pushing further beyond the folky sound they established on 2005&rsquo;s Exploration, their first studio LP. Any of the songs on Wassaic Way could be a single, which speaks to the strength of the songwriting, and also to Guthrie and Irion&rsquo;s underlying goal: they wanted an album that moves them one step closer to getting at the heart of who they are as writers and performers.&ldquo;Every record has been a huge learning curve, and you get pushed beyond your limits, and then your limits are way bigger,&rdquo; Guthrie says. &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re still at the beginning of what we can do as recording artists. I think we&rsquo;re just starting to carve a path that we can walk on.&rdquo;</p><p>\t<strong><a href=\"http://www.jamesmaddock.net\">James Maddock</a></strong> affirms his status as a fixture on the Folk and Americana scene with the release of <em>Another Life</em>, his latest album on Jullian Records. Nodding to &lsquo;70s rock with shimmering acoustic guitars, an understated rhythm section and flourishes of fiddle, mandolin, piano and dobro, <em>Another Life</em> bridges the mainstream appeal of songwriters like Jesse Harris and Norah Jones and the quirkier sensibility of Loudon Wainwright. With funding entirely from fan contributions through PledgeMusic, Maddock worked with producer Matt Pierson, multi-instrumentalist Larry Campbell (who&rsquo;s played with Bob Dylan and Levon Helm) and bassist Tony Scherr (who plays with Norah Jones). After fronting the Columbia Records band Wood, whose debut <em>Songs From Stamford Hill </em>was featured prominently on TV shows such as &ldquo;Dawson&rsquo;s Creek,&rdquo; Maddock moved from England to New York City in 2003. His 2009 album <em>Sunrise On Avenue C</em> won a New York Music Award for Best Americana Album, while follow-up <em>Wake Up And Dream</em> ranked among the top albums of 2011 in WFUV&#39;s Listener Poll. He has performed with Bruce Springsteen, Willie Nile, Aaron Comess (Spin Doctors) and David Immergluck (Counting Crows). According to radio legend Vin Scelsa, Maddock&#39;s &quot;heartbreakingly beautiful and exquisitely crafted&quot; music &quot;touches the soul.&quot; Maddock is a constant live presence in the U.S. and Europe.</p><p>\tAfter thousands of concerts across tens-of-thousands of miles, <strong><a href=\"http://www.mikeandruthy.com/\">Ruth Ungar &amp; Mike Merenda</a></strong> have emerged as one of acoustic America&rsquo;s most revered musical duos. As story-tellers, as singers, as poets and as parents (they tour with their two small children), Mike + Ruthy are heralds of an American cultural awakening that values honesty and togetherness, prefers grit to glitz, and revels in the old-fashioned telling of a story. Described as &ldquo;rich, vintage Americana&rdquo; by Time Out NY, Mike + Ruthy&rsquo;s 2012 Woody Guthrie collaboration &ldquo;My New York City&rdquo; is being hailed as one of the most gorgeous pieces ever to have come out of the archive. Mike + Ruthy can hold an intimate audience in the palm of their hands, and then when it&#39;s festival season it&#39;s time to crank it up a notch and expand the band.&nbsp; An Americana mix of bass, drums and pedal steel add swirl and stomp, making their set even more powerful, and fun for the big stage.&nbsp;&nbsp; A beautiful, live, duo record and a fresh, full-band, studio album are currently in the works for release in 2014 and 2015 respectively.&nbsp;</p><p>\tSong writer and award winning Poet Nyraine Santiago better known as <a href=\"http://www.nyraine.com/\"><strong>Nyraine </strong></a>is a poetic genius born and raised in Harlem. From his earliest years since the age of seven he would spend countless hours writing poems, paraphrasing and memorizing stanzas which eventually led to birthing his own creative talents. Nyraine&rsquo;s first musical forays began at the early age of 11. He became a featured vocalist with the New York Boys Choir with whom he toured with throughout the United States and Internationally. Nyraine performed with legends such as Diana Ross , Michael Bolton and in 1995 was invited to Japan to sing for Pope John Paul III. A very influential point in his early performance life would be when Nyraine and the Boy&#39;s Choir sang alongside Coolio in the live telecast performance of &ldquo;Gangsta&rsquo;s Paradise&rdquo; along with the Legendary Stevie Wonder and LV in Radio City Music Hall at the 1995 Billboard Music Awards.&nbsp; Nyraine has a way of drawing you into his mind and soul with his words which not many can do. It&rsquo;s the combination of the vibrations, frequency of his vocals and his deep over standing of the words he speaks. Some of his current accomplishments include: wining the 2012 Underground Music Awards Lyricist of the year title, featured articles in the XXL Magazine and Hip Hop Weekly. He is the next great MCee .</p><p>\tProvocative, irreverent, controversial and wildly creative, <strong><a href=\"http://http://amandapalmer.net/\">Amanda Palmer</a></strong> is a fearless singer, songwriter, playwright, blogger and an audaciously expressive pianist who simultaneously embraces &ndash; and explodes &ndash; traditional frameworks of music, theater and art. Amanda first came to prominence as one half of the internationally acclaimed punk cabaret duo The Dresden Dolls. In 2008, she released her debut solo album, Who Killed Amanda Palmer, produced by Ben Folds and accompanied by a fine art photography book featuring text by esteemed author Neil Gaiman (who Palmer has since married).&nbsp; Amanda is widely known as &ldquo;The Social Media Queen of Rock-N-Roll&rdquo; for her constant and disarmingly intimate engagement with her fans via her blog, Tumblr, and Twitter, and has been at the vanguard of using both &ldquo;direct to fan&rdquo; and &ldquo;pay what you want&rdquo; business models to build and run her business. In May of 2012 she made international news when she raised nearly $1.2 million pre-selling her new album, Theatre is Evil via Kickstarter. Theatre is Evil went on to debut in the &ldquo;Billboard Top 10&rdquo; when it was released on Sept. 11, 2012, and has been released in over 20 countries on her own label, 8ft records. Amanda was invited to present a &ldquo;TED Talk&rdquo; at TED&rsquo;s 2013 Conference. To date her Talk, &ldquo;The Art of Asking&rdquo;, has been viewed more than 4 million times worldwide. 2013 also saw the release of &ldquo;An Evening with Neil Gaiman &amp; Amanda Palmer&rdquo;- a 3 CD collection of tracks culled from a live tour with her husband and best-selling author Neil Gaiman.</p><p>\tRusted Root, the multi-platinum sextet out of Pittsburgh, evolved around front-man <a href=\"http://www.michaelglabicki.com/site/\"><strong>Michael Glabicki</strong>&rsquo;s</a> distinct sound and grew into a musical entity that has thrived in a non-genre specific category all its own. In addition to the two decades with Rusted Root, Glabicki is exploring new sounds and opening new doors with his solo carrer.&nbsp;&nbsp;He has started touring nationally as a trio act, and explains that although he has his roots with Rusted Root, the sound is very different. &nbsp;Glabicki has always invited the audience to participate in the creation of Rusted Root&rsquo;s music. He frequently tests new songs on the road to see the fan reaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;Constantly writing new material, Glabicki finds that some of it fits his solo sound better than Rusted Root&rsquo;s. &nbsp;He currently routes his solo tours around the Rusted Root schedule, and has multiple performances throughout the year. While not on tour with Rusted Root or working on his solo career, Glabicki also has started his own studio,&nbsp;<em>Red Cloud</em>&nbsp;in Pittsburgh.&nbsp;&nbsp;What started as a place for him to write and record new songs, has now grown into a full scale studio where local musicians can rent space to work on their new albums.&nbsp; A multifaceted musician, producer and songwriter, Glabicki&rsquo;s talents are unique and extremely uplifting.&nbsp;&nbsp;His solo tour dates and new music are extensions of his creative talent, and will inspire all those who participate.</p><p>\tClive Campbell&nbsp;aka&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"http://djkoolherc.com/\">DJ Kool Herc</a></strong>&nbsp;is credited with originating hip hop music.

for the film Big Easy Express, and having their classic single, &quot;Wagon Wheel&quot;, receive the RIAA&#39;s Platinum certification for selling over 1,000,000 copies.</span></p><p>\t<span style=\"color: rgb(102, 102, 102);

line-height: 18.2px; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; font-size: 14px;\">It&#39;s been nearly fifteen years since these humble beginnings, and the band has gone on to tour the world, sell over 800,000 albums, become frequent guests on A Prairie Home Companion, and play renowned festivals like Bonnaroo, Coachella, and Newport Folk Festival.</span></p><p>\t<span style=\"color: rgb(102, 102, 102);

font-size: 14px;\"><span class=\"reverse\">There is nothing like the challenges and camaraderie of the road to inspire a songwriter who thrives upon the emotional energy and exhilaration only travel can deliver. Some singers are devoted to the pursuit of perpetual motion, and Langhorne Slim releases his wild soul in ways that come out of the discipline of live performance.<br />\t<br />\tThe 13 songs that compose Langhorne Slim &amp; The Law&#39;s new &quot;The Way We Move&quot; are road-tested, rollicking and very rock &#39;n&#39; rolling tunes that the songwriter perfected with his loyal band, and come out of the kind of good times and bad experiences that songwriters of Langhorne&#39;s lofty stature can turn into life-affirming rock &#39;n&#39; roll. You could also call what Langhorne Slim does folk music, but then there&#39;s his sly, charming and open-hearted feel for pop music -- those summertime melodies that nudge you into a grin even when the song is about something bad.<br />\t<br />\tFor Langhorne Slim -- Pennsylvania-born self-taught guitarist who moves to Brooklyn at 18, begins feeling out his place in a burgeoning punk-folk scene, wends his way to the West Coast, and finds himself celebrated from Newport to Portland as one of today&#39;s most original singers and songwriters -- &quot;The Way We Move&quot; represents the sound of a band devoted to living in the moment. Riding the success of his 2009 full-length Be Set Free, Langhorne went through some changes over the last three years -- he lost his beloved grandfather, who is the subject of the new record&#39;s moving &quot;Song for Sid,&quot; and moved on from a relationship that had lasted five years.<br />\t<br />\tAnd there was the physical moving -- the literal side of the record&#39;s title. Pulling up stakes from his home of two years, Portland, Ore., Langhorne also has been touring non-stop with The Law. As he says, &quot;I&#39;m in a bit of a transitional period -- currently, the road will be home. That&#39;s just kind of my spirit, to be slightly restless.&quot; Perfecting their rangy sound out on the endless grey ribbon, Langhorne and The Law -- bassist Jeff Ratner, drummer Malachi DeLorenzo and banjo player and keyboardist David Moore -- went down to rural Texas in the summer of 2011 to work on new material. With some 30 tunes to consider, the quartet soaked up the Lone Star sunshine and developed arrangements and approaches for Langhorne&#39;s latest batch of songs.<br />\t<br />\tJeff Ratner had joined the group at the time of Be Set Free, and brought on multi-instrumentalist David Moore not long after. Moore and Ratner go way back, having moved to New York around the same time, and they&#39;ve played together in what Jeff estimates are 15 bands. Langhorne&#39;s association with Malachi is equally deep. As the group played together through tours with the Drive-By Truckers and the Avett Brothers, and made appearances at the Newport Folk Festival and Bonnaroo, their bond became ever stronger, their music more confident. This is what you hear on &quot;The Way We Move&quot; -- forward motion meeting deep cohesion, all in the service of Langhorne&#39;s amazing songs and compelling vocals.<br />\t<br />\t&quot;We wanted Langhorne&#39;s songs to shine, and be as raw as the creatures that we are,&quot; Jeff says of the recording process. The band set up in the Catskill, N.Y. Old Soul Studio, a 100-year-old Greek Revival house retooled for recording. With studio owner Kenny Siegal co-producing, Langhorne &amp; The Law fearlessly ran through an astounding 26 songs in four days, with Langhorne putting finishing touches on new tunes as they recorded. Langhorne says it was an intimate affair in Old Soul, with Moore&#39;s &quot;banjo room&quot; in a coatroom and the piano in the living room.<br />\t<br />\tIt comes through on &quot;The Way We Move&quot; -- the live feel of the sessions, which found Langhorne singing along with the band on every track. &quot;Singing with the band that way, it&#39;s almost like I was performing on stage,&quot; he says. Cutting everything live to tape gave the band exactly what they&#39;d been looking for: a super-charged evocation of their raucous, friendly stage performances. Langhorne and Jeff value in music for its rawness, and it doesn&#39;t matter whether that rawness -- the insurgent spirit that unites the Clash and Charlie Poole -- comes from in punk, country, soul or folk. Langhorne is a fan of Porter Wagoner, Jimmie Rodgers, Waylon Jennings, and early rock &#39;n&#39; roll in general. But there&#39;s nothing referential or detached about the music Langhorne &amp; The Law make. Langhorne writes songs that are yearning, sad, happy, defeated and optimistic, with hints of &#39;50s rock &#39;n&#39; roll balladry.<br />\t<br />\t&quot;We all love Wu-Tang Clan as much as we love Bowie, or Brazilian psychedelic pop,&quot; Langhorne says. On &quot;The Way We Move,&quot; David&#39;s probing piano often provides focus for Langhorne&#39;s tales of love and loss. &quot;On the Attack&quot; begins with a delicate, watercolor section that turns into an ingenious variation on a classic soul ballad -- Solomon Burke meets punk blues in a smoky folk club. Langhorne addresses it to a current or past love. Similarly, &quot;Past Lives&quot; sports a piano introduction that gives way to a melancholy 6/8 ballad that perfectly supports lyrics about possible past lives and their interaction with the present.<br />\t<br />\tIt&#39;s a spirited, inspired slice of real rock &#39;n&#39; roll -- exuberance meets hard-won experience in an explosive combination. David&#39;s banjo and Malachi&#39;s walloping drums add up to a new kind of folk music. The music drives, but there&#39;s no loss of subtlety. And when the group lays into the garage-rocking &quot;Fire,&quot; with its funky electric piano and supremely callow lyrics about first kisses and the hot-burning passions of adolescence, it&#39;s clear Langhorne is one of the great rock &#39;n&#39; rollers of our or any time.<br />\t<br />\tRoad-tested as the band is, the new music also shows just how far Langhorne Slim has come as a singer. He croons, exults and sings the blues throughout &quot;The Way We Move.&quot; And there are his lyrics, which are about strange dreams featuring women who want him dead even as he desires them, the pressures of small-town life, ambition, and how much he appreciates his mother&#39;s love and support. That&#39;s all Langhorne and his life -- his mother, he says, really was amazingly supportive of his ambitions to become a musician, as was the rest of his family.<br />\t<br />\tIt comes through as you listen to his virtuoso demonstration of a singing style that seems alive to every fleeting emotional shade of meaning. Langhorne puts you in mind of John Lennon&#39;s singing from time to time -- it&#39;s nothing exact, and Slim doesn&#39;t do much music that is very Lennon- or Beatle-esque, but it&#39;s something in the timbre, and the openness of his vocals. It&#39;s worth repeating here that Langhorne learned Nirvana songs as he began to explore the guitar and songwriting, and Kurt Cobain&#39;s intense singing is another reference point.<br />\t<br />\tBut these guys don&#39;t play the reference game, and like to keep it raw. The new record moves in ways that are fresh for Langhorne Slim &amp; The Law, and demonstrates all the ways we can go forward while keeping an eye on the mirror. They&#39;re laying down the law. It&#39;s very American, and when Langhorne Slim contemplates whether or not he fits in to any narrow-cast definition of this country&#39;s music, he replies with a perfect, laconic joke: &quot;I think we fit in most places that would take us.&quot;</span></span></p><p></p><p>\t<span style=\"color: rgb(102, 102, 102); line-height: 18.2px; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; font-size: 14px;\"><span class=\"reverse\">Spirit Family Reunion:</span></span></p><p>\t<span style=\"color: rgb(102, 102, 102); line-height: 18.2px; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; font-size: 14px;\"><span class=\"reverse\">Spirit Family Reunion play homegrown American music to stomp, clap, shake and holler with.

A tree summarizes in an exemplary way the contrast between two forces: the force of gravity and the weight of life we are part of. The need and the search for balance, which exists in every living being to counteract the force of gravity, is evident in every step and in every small action of our lives. It is a river stone that appears amid the branches of a tree. A stone suspended amid the branches of a tree, separated from the soil by a structure that is not land and is not air, a stone that lies between the force of gravity and the force of the attraction of light.&rdquo;</p>\t- See more at: http://www.madisonsquarepark.org/things-to-do/calendar/mad-sq-art-giuseppe-penone#sthash.lBVaxX5M.dpuf</div><p>\tMadison Square Park Conservancy&rsquo;s Mad. Sq. Art&#39;s sculptural installation for fall 2013 is by renowned Italian artist Giuseppe Penone and consists of three monumental, 30-foot tall bronze trees. <em>Ideas of Stone (Idee di pietra)</em>, featuring Penone&rsquo;s signature manipulation of the trees&rsquo; natural forms, will interact with Madison Square Park&rsquo;s lush landscape to highlight the relationships amongst man, sculpture and nature<em>. </em>The installation will remain on view daily from September 26, 2013 through February 9, 2014 in Madison Square Park.</p><p>\tThroughout his 40-year career, Penone has employed natural materials and forms in an exploration of the contrasting and fundamental relationships between man and nature. Penone was a member of the Italian <em>Arte Povera</em> movement, which was comprised of artists who sought to dissolve divisions between art and life by using commonplace subjects and materials in their work. Trees as living sculpture is a recurring theme for Penone. He often manipulates these natural forms by twisting, deconstructing, hollowing, and uprooting the organic figures. He incorporates traces of fingerprints, nails, wires, carvings, and precariously placed boulders as remnant evidence of the sculptures&rsquo; manmade composition and the effect of human interaction with the natural world. Penone addresses concepts of weight, balance, and scale, while merging the manmade and the organic.</p>",

The resulting work teeters between representation and abstraction &ndash; teasing recognizable forms out of abstract ones or abstracting recognizable elements through stripping down or layering/obscuring. Specific works were selected for the exhibition that can trace the evolution of most artists&rsquo; work processes.</p><p>Psychologists refer to &ldquo;processing trauma&rdquo; as transforming painful emotions into constructive meaning. &nbsp;&nbsp;Many of these artists view their practice as a way to elucidate or overcome specific personal or societal obsessions, fears, or anxieties&mdash;such that the manipulation of art materials becomes a therapeutic process.</p><p>The opening of&nbsp;Processing&nbsp;coincides with&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.gowanusswimsociety.com/\">Gowanus Open Studios&nbsp;(GOS)</a> an annual weekend-long event in which local artists invite the public into their studios. By continuing to participate in GOS each year, OSH hopes to both support local artists and call attention to their increased displacement from this community as a result of gentrification. Once all based out of a no longer extant central Gowanus location, the Gowanus Swim Society artists are now dispersed across New York City or other cities. These shifts have also impacted their individual and collective work processes.</p><p><strong>Artwork:</strong></p><p>Kristen Haskell&nbsp;describes their work process as &ldquo;a cycle of creating, narrating, abstracting, studying, organizing, and disorganizing.&rdquo; Their recent work centers around common fears, both rational and irrational, from spiders to losing one&rsquo;s teeth. It is created in two stages: the wet energy stage, in which Haskell &ldquo;lets out their aggression quickly&rdquo; with Sumi Ink and Fluid Acrylic; and the meditative linear stage, where the artist often creates &ldquo;new characters&rdquo; from the forms, patterns, and lines within the more spontaneous shapes created during the first stage.</p><p>Free-form ink blots are also the starting point for&nbsp;John Fisk&rsquo;s ongoing &ldquo;Inklins&rdquo; series. He uses an eyedropper to create splatters on watercolor paper with organic lines and naturally-occurring shading. He then turns each one into a macabre creature, inspired by the psychology of Rorschach tests, horror entertainment, and cartoon animation.</p><p>Mary Negro&nbsp;and&nbsp;Natalie Fisk, by contrast, begin with recognizable symbols and texts which they alter and conceal to the point of being barely recognizable.&nbsp;Mary Negro&nbsp;uses colored pencil to layer streams of handwritten, stream-of-consciousness text across large paper. The sentences are then contoured with ink, further disabling the viewer&rsquo;s ability to read the text, which collapses into a thick web of gestural marks. Negro&rsquo;s journaling method helps her process difficult personal and political events, &ldquo;visualizing a sense of overwhelm, frustration, or tension, while simultaneously evoking contemporary issues related to censorship, transparency, memory, and record-keeping.&rdquo;</p><p>Natalie Fisk&nbsp;provides a window into her Mexican-American and female identities through the negative and positive spaces created in hand- cut and painted papel picado, often collaged upon other domestic patterns as well as feminist comics. Fisk aims to &ldquo;push and pull her viewer through various degrees of clarification, capturing the space between identified subject and affable uncertainty.&rdquo;</p><p>Abigail Groff Hernandez&rsquo;s latest work addresses the physical behaviors that mark her father&rsquo;s descent into dementia, such as folding cloth and tearing paper. &nbsp;The obsessive detail in her depictions of crumpled metallic paper renders their subject barely recognizable and invites a range of interpretations. &ldquo;At their most basic, the drawings are depicting the breakdown of shapes created by folding and crumpling&hellip;in practice, they are an observational, rhythmic and methodical way to find mindfulness and order amidst heartbreaking, hopeless circumstances.&rdquo;</p><p>Jessica Dalrymple&nbsp;and&nbsp;Suzy Kopf&rsquo;s more representational work deeply investigates and re-frames our natural and built environment.&nbsp;Jessica Dalrymple&rsquo;s&nbsp;Native/Non Native&nbsp;and&nbsp;NYC Natural&nbsp;paintings exhaustively catalog and advocate for plant and animal species found in cities. After accumulating photos and sketches while immersed in the landscape, Dalrymple fuses them together into compositions that often obscure traditional perspectives and juxtapose painterly and photo-realistic elements to &ldquo;express harmonies between nature and the city.&rdquo;</p><p>Suzy Kopf&nbsp;is interested in the &ldquo;American propensity towards sameness, which stands in direct contrast with our supposed fierce need to be unique.&rdquo; Also working from both her photographs and memory, Kopf often strips her urbanscapes of detail to focus on their most iconic shapes, colors, and symbols. Her paintings in&nbsp;Processing&nbsp;document Puerto Rico&rsquo;s Levittown, which she visited in March 2017 before the island was devastated by Hurricane Maria. This planned housing community teleported midcentury design while being peppered with current automobiles and references to contemporary life. The work addresses such personal and societal tensions as, &ldquo;What does it mean to be at home in the beautiful and the banal? What does prosperity for all mean in a time when we know we can&rsquo;t all have it?&rdquo;</p><p>Melissa Johnson&rsquo;s music video&nbsp;The Look&nbsp;suggests the potential of breaking with fashion and performance conventions to express a rich inner world. Through a series of fantasy dressing room scenes in a fantasy mall, lead character Melody Henson finds empowerment through her unique style. With song and movement, the protagonist communicates her belief in &ldquo;self-expression, sisterhood, and the power of diversity.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>About Gowanus Swim Society:</strong></p><p>Gowanus Swim Society is a select group of mostly Brooklyn-based artists who meet regularly, exhibit often and provide a forum for sharing information and artist resources. The artists function as a collective and hold monthly meetings during which they work together to accomplish common goals, hold one another accountable for personal progress through group crits and acquire new skills from one another. They also host public social events and art exhibitions of their work throughout the year. They are always eager to collaborate with other artists and organizations to work towards common goals.</p><p><strong>About The Curator:</strong></p><p>Katherine Gressel, the Old Stone House &amp; Washington Park&rsquo;s Contemporary Art Curator, is a New York-based curator, artist, and writer focused on site-specific art. She earned her BA in art from Yale and MA in arts administration from Columbia. Katherine&rsquo;s previous exhibits dealing with such topics as income inequality, urban agriculture, and parks have been recognized by the New York Times, Time Out New York, Hyperallergic, News 12 Brooklyn, and DNAInfo. In addition to organizing ten major exhibitions to date at the Old Stone House, Katherine has curated for FIGMENT, No Longer Empty, and Brooklyn Historical Society, and was the 2016 NARS Foundation emerging curator. &nbsp;She was selected for the 2015 Independent Curators International (ICI) Curatorial Intensive in New Orleans. Katherine has written and presented on public and community art issues for Createquity, Americans for the Arts, and Public Art Dialogue, among others. Katherine also served as Programs Manager at Smack Mellon Gallery from 2010-2014, and has worked and consulted for diverse nonprofits in the areas of arts education, project management, and development.</p><p>Funding for&nbsp;Processing&nbsp;is made possible, in part, by the Shelley &amp; Donald Rubin Foundation and the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>"
