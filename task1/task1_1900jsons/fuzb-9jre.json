As there is a moderate chance of encountering findings of significance on East 53rd, 42nd, and Broome Streets, recommendations include that of new boring tests to evaluate the sensitivity of the site while particularly archaeologically rich areas would be further studied. The 14th Street site is considered unlikely to harbor archaeological remains though if boring tests were to indicate otherwise, this could refer to a rare Native American site that would be National Register eligible. Were a finding confirmed on this site, it is recommended that archaeological sites either be avoided in construction of the Second Avenue Subway or, if this were not possible, that proper recovery efforts be made to preserve findings.

This testing found that prehistoric remains here were likely an extension of Old Place Neck site finds, and also indicated that the site was inhabited during other prehistoric and historic periods, including a wealth of remains from the mid-19th century.
