The Fire Code is a companion code to the New York City Construction Codes and Zoning Resolution, with extensive cross-references to the Building, Mechanical and Electrical Codes.    The Fire Code is newly-amended in 2014 to adopt many of the latest fire safety technologies and standards from the International Fire Code, together with important New York City-specific provisions. The 2014 Fire Code comprehensively amends the emergency preparedness requirements for buildings and occupancies, and makes significant changes in provisions relating to fire apparatus access roads and building frontage spaces; rooftop access and obstructions; rooftop solar panel installations; construction site fire safety standards; fire watch and notification requirements for out-of-service building fire protection systems; building and apartment identification standards; and use of medical oxygen, portable electric space heaters and halogen lamps.    The 2014 Fire Code is an indispensable reference for design professionals, building owners and managers, and others engaged in trades and businesses regulated by the Fire Code, to ensure that buildings or facilities for which they are responsible are lawfully designed, operated and maintained. The Fire Code amendments took effect on March 30, 2014.    Soft Cover. 444 pages",

                        "America s largest city generates garbage in torrents - 11,000 tons a day on average. In Picking Up, the anthropologist Robin Nagle introduces us to the men and women of New York City s Department of Sanitation and makes clear why this small army of uniformed workers is the most important labor force on the streets. Seeking to understand every aspect of the Department s mission, Nagle accompanied crews on their routes, questioned supervisors and commissioners, and listened to story after story about blizzards, hazardous wastes, and the insults of everyday New Yorkers. But the more time she spent with the DSNY, the more Nagle realized that observing wasn t quite enough - so she joined the force herself. Driving the hulking trucks, she obtained an insider s perspective on the complex kinships, arcane rules, and obscure lingo unique to the realm of sanitation workers.    Nagle chronicles New York City s four-hundred-year struggle with trash, and traces the city s waste-management efforts from a time when filth overwhelmed the streets to the far more rigorous practices of today, when the Big Apple is as clean as it s ever been.    Throughout, Nagle reveals the many unexpected ways in which sanitation workers stand between our seemingly well-ordered lives and the sea of refuse that would otherwise overwhelm us. In the process, she changes the way we understand cities - and ourselves within them.    By Robin Nagle    304 pages. 8 x 6 inches. Paperback.",

                        "A fact-filled, alphabetical journey through the five boroughs of the city. A pigeon serves as a tour guide of sorts, appearing on every page in either the small inset illustration or in one of the smaller spot-art drawings located along the bottom of the pages. The format works well to introduce famous landmarks and neighborhoods with descriptive alliterative sentences, such as   Dragons dance by dim sum diners   as an introduction to Chinatown and   Gorgeous gardens grace glass-houses   for commentary on the New York Botanical Garden. Succinct paragraphs of historical information are located under each full-page, highly detailed colored-pencil-and-watercolor illustration. In a much smaller type size, a one-sentence, sometimes quirky, bit of information is imparted as well, as in   Many skyscrapers don t have a 13th floor. No one wants to be on an unlucky floor!   This up-to-date book includes a reference to and inset illustration of the former Twin Towers under the letter T:   Tough times take teamwork.   The book begins with a map and a listing of the 26 landmarks showcased. The endpapers offer a different sort of New York alphabet to readers, featuring small illustrations of interesting trademark items, such as a Nathan s hot dog, a blue box from Tiffany s, and a yellow cab. A wonderful testament to a diverse city and its equally diverse residents.   -School Library Journal, 32 pages."
