Our staff effort is guided by our shared love of teaching and learning, combined with our recognition of educational possibilities rooted in the interplay of arts and academics.

Fordham University's CFN 551 is our support network. We have a theater scene shop, dedicated dance studio, black box theater, full-sized auditorium, two vocal chorus rooms, and a radio station. We communicate with students and parents through our school website, daily morning and afternoon announcements, monthly Town Hall meetings, our TAPCo radio station, an active Parent Association, weekly student meetings with staff agents, and an open door policy for all administration. TAPCo also just held our inaugural Student Council elections to give students voice and experience in the democratic process. TAPCo celebrates student success through commemorating all student work via video and photographs, awards assemblies, and our recently formed National Honor Society.

Students are drawn from all five boroughs of NYC and hail from diverse ethnic backgrounds. When students graduate, they are prepared for college and for life beyond by HSMSE's in-depth approach to learning. New York State Regents exams, while required, are viewed as minimal competencies which our students are expected to master. Our curriculum exceeds the state standards in every way. Most HSMSE courses are taught at the advanced, AP and college level, and some courses earn college credit from The City College of New York. Students select one of three concentrations at the end of 10th grade, taking advanced coursework in either Advanced Engineering, Biomedical Research or Mathematics in 11th and 12th grades. HSMSE also offers a variety of elective classes and academic teams across departments. The school day is from 8:00 AM to 3:35 PM",
