For additional information and the 2014 test dates, see the front of this directory and obtain a copy of the Specialized High Schools Student Handbook from your guidance counselor., Stuyvesant offers sophisticated research programs in science, computer science, mathematics, and the social sciences. They begin with introductory research classes in the earlier grades, and grow in complexity as students develop more advanced skills and understanding. Science research, for example, begins in 9th grade with honors experimental research biology, continues with similar high-level courses in chemistry & physics, and culminates in the senior Intel/Siemens research competition class. In addition, a wide array of science electives enhances students' academic opportunities in these field. This highly successful sequential approach has resulted in 13 Intel semifinalists (and the 3rd-place national winner) in 2012 and ten semifinalists in 2013, leading the nation in this category for both years., Chancellor\u2019s Arts Endorsed Diploma",
