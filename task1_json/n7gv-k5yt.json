New transfer air ducts are being installed on floors 2, 7 & 8 to assist in the proper function of the return air system. Additional fan coil units are being installed to serve several rooms on the 8th floor & the 7th floor elevator lobby.    ENGINATOR EXHAUST HEAT  This scope involves a means of venting excessive heat that builds up in a shaft way that houses the enginator exhaust pipe that begins in lower level 2 up and out through the roof of the building. The heat emanates through the shaft way walls into the building.  This will be accomplished by installing a new exhaust fan and a makeup air fan that pumps outside air into the shaft way.    CURTAINWALL SHADOW BOX HEAT TRANSFER  Original design created conditions where curtain wall mullions heated to temperatures in excess of 110 F. This scope of works involves installing new metal stud with sheetrock finishes over interior curtain wall mullions. Affected locations are portions of the 2nd floor east side exposure.    WATER PENETRATION THROUGH UNDERGROUND CONDUITS  An existing underground conduit experienced water infiltration which caused those conductors to fail. Those conductors are going to be removed and the conduit abandoned. A new above ground path has been designed for the new feeder.    INTERIOR GLASS REPLACEMENT  Replace 4 sections of glazing at Stair A and 1 section at Stair B.    CONDENSER WATER SYSTEM WITH THREE ROOF TOP DRY COOLERS  Furnish and install a complete new A/C condenser cooling glycol system that includes roof top dry coolers and associated piping. This new system will serve chilled water A/C units in IT closets and elevator machine rooms throughout the building.    REMOVAL OF EXCESS HEAT FROM COURTROOM AV CLOSETS  This scope of work involve installing fans in the ceilings of all the audio visual closets to vent out heated air from all the equipment inside the closet on floors 3-6.  New hollow metal doors with louvers will also be installed.",
