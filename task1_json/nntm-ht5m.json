The DOE will begin to expand the Discovery program to 20 percent of seats at each SHS and adjust the eligibility criteria to target students attending high-poverty schools. Based on modeling of current offer patterns, an estimated 16 percent of offers would go to black and Latino students, compared to 9 percent currently. (2) Eliminating the use of the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test (SHSAT) as the sole criterion for admissions over three years. The elimination of the SHSAT would require State legislation. By the end of the elimination, the SHS would use the \u201cUniversity of Texas model,\u201d where seats are reserved for top performers at each New York City middle school.
