Kennedy Airport, any new development (as defined in the N.Y.C. Zoning Resolution) of this parcel may require window wall attenuation and an alternate means of ventilation to maintain acceptable interior noise levels. Property owners should consult the most recent noise exposure map for the airport and the N.Y.C. CEPO-CEQR standards to determine the appropriate amount of window-wall attenuation required for any new development. Such measures must be incorporated into the building design in conformance with the aforementioned standards. (10) RESTRICTIVE COVENANT (all parcels): Purchaser/grantee acknowledges that the parcel being conveyed pursuant to this deed (the Parcel) includes a waterfront zoning lot within the meaning of Section 62-11 of the Zoning Resolution of the City of New York (the Zoning Resolution). Purchaser/grantee covenants for itself and on behalf of any lessees, subsequent purchasers, successors or assigns to all or any part of the Parcel that, in connection with any proposed development (as such term is defined in Section 62-11 of the Zoning Resolution) on the Parcel purchaser/grantee will comply with all applicable requirements of Chapter 2 of Article VI of the Zoning Resolution, including the requirements of Section 62-711 (Waterfront public access and visual corridors). As part of such obligation, purchaser/grantee shall not apply for nor accept an excavation or building permit for any development on the parcel, nor shall an excavation or building permit be issued until such time as the Chair of the Department of City Planning certifies to the Department of Buildings or the Department of Business Services, as applicable, pursuant to Section 62-711 that: (1) no public access or visual corridors are required; (2) that a site plan has been submitted showing compliance with the provisions of Sections 62-40 and 62-60 of the Zoning Resolution, and all other requirements of Section 62-711 have been met; or (3) an authorization pursuant to Section 62-722 (Modifications of Waterfront Public Access and Visual Corridor Requirements) has been granted. For purposes of determining purchaser/grantees waterfront obligations hereunder, such obligations shall be based upon the zoning lot containing the Parcel existing as of September 3, 1997. (11) NOTICE: DEC WETLANDS (when applicable):  All or part of this parcel may be part of a tidal wetland or a tidal wetland adjacent area. Tidal wetlands and tidal wetland adjacent areas are regulated under New York State law by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation ('DEC'). DEC has jurisdiction over tidal wetlands and buffer area (the adjacent area), which measures in Broad Channel (and other parts of New York City) up to 150 feet landward of the most landward boundary of a mapped tidal wetland. The official tidal wetland maps can be viewed at the DEC Region 2 offices.  The City of New York makes no representation with respect to the designation of all or part of this parcel as tidal wetland or tidal wetland adjacent area. To the extent that this parcel is within a regulated tidal wetland or tidal wetland adjacent area, important restrictions apply. Depending on the particular circumstances of this parcel, any form of development on this parcel may be prohibited or restricted.",

Article 25 of the New York State Environmental Conservation Law (the Tidal Wetlands Act) provides that anyone conducting a regulated activity within a tidal wetland or tidal wetland adjacent area must first obtain a permit from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. Conducting a regulated activity without a permit constitutes a violation. Any violation of the Tidal Wetlands Act can result in a significant penalty (at the time of this indenture up to $10,000 per day for each violation) as well as criminal sanctions. In addition, unpermitted structures and fill have to be removed at the owners expense. Regulated activities include, for example:  Any form of draining, dredging, excavation and removal (directly or indirectly) of soil, mud, sand, shells, gravel or other aggregate from any tidal wetland;  Any form of dumping, filling or depositing (directly or indirectly) of any soil, stones, sand, mud, gravel, rubbish or fill of any kind;  The erection of any structures or roads, the driving of any pilings or the placing of any other obstructions, whether or not changing the ebb and flow of the tide; and  Any other activity within or immediately adjacent to inventoried wetlands which may substantially impair or alter the natural condition of the tidal wetland area;  Any subdivision of land. This list is not complete. It is therefore advisable to contact the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, Region 2, Marine Resources Program prior to any activity within the tidal wetland or tidal wetland adjacent area to clarify whetheror not a permit is required.  (13) SEWER EASEMENT (when applicable):  The City of New York hereby retains unto itself a permanent and perpetual easement 30 feet wide centered over the existing sewer main located within the premises herein granted.  No permanent structures shall be erected within, under or less than twenty feet above the easement area.

The easement is retained for the purpose of allowing the Citys Department of Environmental Protection and other necessary parties the free right to enter upon the easement area at all times with vehicles, equipment and material to inspect, operate, use, maintain, repair or replace the sewer main.  The easement shall run with the land and remain in full force and effect for as long as the sewer/water main continues in use as determined by the City.   (13) WATER MAIN EASEMENT (when applicable): The City of New York hereby retains unto itself a permanent and perpetual easement 10 feet wide centered over the existing water main located within the premises hereby granted. No permanent structures shall be erected within, under or less than twenty feet above the easement area.
