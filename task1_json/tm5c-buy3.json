The EpiQuery module from which this dataset\u2019s current and historical crude and age-adjusted rates are manually extracted is updated whenever a new population estimate (denominator) becomes available. For example, when vintage 2016 population estimates become available, EpiQuery updates 2014 and 2015 rates.  As a result, rates change for historical years, creating discrepancies between Open Data and current EpiQuery.  The program requests that the OpenData module remains fully consistent with the EpiQuery module. However, to update the OpenData module would require the team to manually update the OpenData source file for all 10 diseases and all years that are currently listed, which the team currently does not have the bandwidth for. The Agency\u2019s Bureau of Epidemiology Services is currently working to develop a process that would allow for automated data extraction from EpiQuery to the OpenData portal.  Once automated, this will ensure that there are no discrepancies between what is presented on Open Data and EpiQuery. When this process is activated, we will request that the dataset be made available again on OpenData.  In the interim, interested users should visit the Communicable Disease Surveillance Data module on EpiQuery for the most current data: https://a816-healthpsi.nyc.gov/epiquery/CDSS/index.html.",
