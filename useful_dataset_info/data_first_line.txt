Request	What question are you trying to answer with this data?	Submission Date	Response	Final Determination Given (Y/N)
I was looking for data from Feb-2019 to Jun-2019 for the FHV Base Aggregate Report. When I downloaded the data, it only provided info. through Jan-2019. Is there a particular link to get access to the past 5 months?	comparing market shares of ride hailing services in NYC (Uber, Lyft, Via)	07/15/2019 12:00:00 AM	Hi,Thanks for reaching out. Because new TLC rules have split the for-hire vehicle license into two separate license types, High Volume FHV and Traditional FHV, which have different data reporting standards, our IT team has required additional development time to update our monthly aggregate reports on Open Data. We anticipate that this work will be done soon, so please check back frequently-- once they are ready, they will be published to the same table that you referenced. Thanks,Elizabeth MajorNYC Open Data + Taxi and Limousine Commission

6	06M018	Park Terrace (P.S. 18)	Our school is a close-knit learning community where teachers create a family-type environment focused on technology and the arts. We focus on the individual student and foster an environment that encourages students to take risks. Our focus on transitional bilingual courses, monolingual courses, and dual language education in Spanish and English supports academic excellence across all content areas. We engage our parents in school-wide events and gatherings focused on building community. Our parents are at the heart of our efforts. Parents appreciate our non-negotiable uniform policy, excellent discipline and communication protocol, and our administration's open door policy. Many of our students are new arrivals from the Dominican Republic. Our school engages in a variety of programs celebrating literacy and the arts as well as STEM across grades.

Cultural Center		DreamYard Drama Project	DreamYard is committed to helping transform Bronx schools and communities through the power of innovative, project based arts education. Our schools and students are based in the nation's poorest urban county, with one-third of the Bronx's residents living below the poverty line. In response, DreamYard programs are designed to challenge the cyclical systems of inequality and poverty by empowering youth to discover and develop their best possible selves and to locate meaningful paths and ways to engage with their fellow students, schools, families, and communities. As the largest arts education provider in the Bronx, DreamYard critically impacts the social and intellectual growth of thousands of Bronx youth through safe, positive and creatively challenging programs. DreamYard's team of professional artists partner with classroom teachers and community educators to help students learn how to express, write and perform their own stories. Through yearlong programs offered during the school day, after school, on weekends and during the summer, DreamYard supports youth development, enhances life-long learning skills, and promotes creative thinking and expression.

While in pursuit of knowledge about other world regions, including their histories, economies and world languages, students acquire the knowledge and skills needed to prepare for college and/or careers. Teachers and other adults who make up the learning community forge supportive relationships with students and parents while providing challenging and engaging learning experiences. Our school partners with various community, arts, and business organizations to help students achieve success. Our theme of international studies extends beyond the classroom, where students participate in ongoing ‘Advisory Day Out’ excursions where the multiculturalism of NYC becomes the classroom.

3-K - High School	Released diversity plan to facilitate more diverse and inclusive schools and programs	In June 2017, the DOE released Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools. The release of this diversity plan is the next step in the City’s ongoing work to increase school diversity. It represents a critical milestone in the City’s Equity and Excellence for All agenda, and begins to lay out an approach to increasing diversity in the school system. The plan sets specific initial goals for making schools more diverse and inclusive that will be reported on annually. This includes 12 proposals to address policies and practices that pose challenges to school diversity; this report is organized in a way that aligns each activity to one of these proposals.

An Interpretive Approach to Understanding Working-Class Life   (Yamin, Rebecca)	This report is Volume II of a six volume study on excavations conducted  between Worth and Pearl Streets in Lower Manhattan; in the 19th century the block formed part of the notorious slum known as Five Points. Volume II is a collection of scholarly papers exploring what the excavated artifacts can tell us about the daily lives and relationships of the people who called Five Points home. The papers address topics like the rise of Tammany Hall in local politics, medicine in 19th century slums, and Block 160's brothels.	Five Points, Tammany Hall,19th century New York

Pre-Kindergarten-12th Grade	Provided grant funding for schools to increase school diversity through recruitment & support of diverse learners	The Progressive Redesign Opportunity Schools for Excellence (PROSE) used funding from the National Education Association to provide $750 mini-grants and an opportunity to apply for up to $5000 in mini grant funding to 10 schools who sought to increase diversity in their school communities. Many of these schools utilized this funding to provide planning time for school staff working on diversity issues, as well as to do additional recruitment and outreach to underrepresented populations through school fairs and direct communication to families. Additionally, schools also utilized this funding to better equip their schools to support diverse learners. Examples of these activities included full-day professional development and guest speakers.	Schools interested in additional supports for diverse learners and creating diverse schools	Building School Infrastructure to Support Diversity

02M260	Clinton School Writers & Artists, M.S. 260	M	Students who are prepared for college must have an education that encourages them to take risks as they produce and perform. Our college preparatory curriculum develops writers and has built a tight-knit community. Our school develops students who can think analytically and write creatively. Our arts programming builds on our 25 years of experience in visual, performing arts and music on a middle school level. We partner with New Audience and the Whitney Museum as cultural partners. We are a International Baccalaureate (IB) candidate school that offers opportunities to take college courses at neighboring universities.	1	Free college courses at neighboring universities	International Travel, Special Arts Programs, Music, Internships, College Mentoring English Language Learner Programs: English as a New Language				English as a New Language				Chelsea-Union Sq			M868	10 East 15th Street, Manhattan NY 10003 (40.736526, -73.992727)	212-524-4360	212-524-4365	admissions@theclintonschool.net	www.theclintonschool.net	1, 2, 3, F, M to 14th St - 6th Ave; 4, 5, L, Q to 14th St-Union Square; 6, N, R to 23rd St	BM1, BM2, BM3, BM4, BxM10, BxM6, BxM7, BxM8, BxM9, M1, M101, M102, M103, M14A, M14D, M15, M15-SBS, M2, M20, M23, M3, M5, M7, M8, QM21, X1, X10, X10B, X12, X14, X17, X2, X27, X28, X37, X38, X42, X5, X63, X64, X68, X7, X9	6-11	6-12	376				CUNY College Now, Technology, Model UN, Student Government, School Leadership Team, Music, School Musical, National Honor Society, The Clinton Post (School Newspaper), Clinton Soup (Literary Magazine), GLSEN, Glee				Cross Country, Track and Field, Soccer, Flag Football, Basketball		0.970000029	0.899999976		0.970000029										1											See theclintonschool.net for more information.

Pre-Kindergarten-12th Grade	Provided grant funding for schools to increase school diversity through recruitment & support of diverse learners	The Progressive Redesign Opportunity Schools for Excellence (PROSE) used funding from the National Education Association to provide $750 mini-grants and an opportunity to apply for up to $5000 in mini grant funding to 10 schools who sought to increase diversity in their school communities. Many of these schools utilized this funding to provide planning time for school staff working on diversity issues, as well as to do additional recruitment and outreach to underrepresented populations through school fairs and direct communication to families. Additionally, schools also utilized this funding to better equip their schools to support diverse learners. Examples of these activities included full-day professional development and guest speakers.

Our school partners with various community, arts, and business organizations to help students meet success.

12	12X341	Accion Academy	"At ACCION Academy, we have a unique opportunity to provide an individualized, warm, and caring environment for our students because our school is just the right size. Serving an average of only 135 students per year, ACCION is less than one-third the size of the average middle school in New York. This means that our compassionate veteran teachers can form meaningful relationships with students and parents on the journey towards success. We can give each child our full attention to ensure they receive whatever services, programs, or activities they need to grow. ACCION stands for ""Achievement, Community, Consciousness, Integrity, Opportunity Now!"" Our family-oriented school community fosters the highest levels of achievement, mentoring, and service. The student government helps to influence our school's decisions. The CBO we work with is the PHIPPS program. They provide enrichment and recreational activities to promote student autonomy and hands on activity to through role play and problem solving during the after-school program. Furthermore, there are variety of activities including a robotics team, comic book illustration intramural sports, drama, dance, and much more."
