Food had been cooling for 2 1/2  hours as per operators statement. Food was cooked and then moved into the front food prep/service area's refrigerated display case (where food was initially observed) to cool 2 1/2 hours prior to testing, as per Anees' statement. Cooling method inadequate in that this refrigeration unit was observed functioning inadequately and holding foods at an ambient temperature of 68 \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdF. Corrective action: Proper cooling procedures implemented by icing down foods in the refrigerator. Food was found between 140\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdF(60\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdC) and 70\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdF(21.",
